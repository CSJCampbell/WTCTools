\title{Get player one's probability of winning}
\usage{
getPred(data, pairlookup, round = "round", player1 = "player1",
  player2 = "player2", result = "result", list1 = "list1",
  list2 = "list2")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame with columns round,
player1, player2, result, list1, list2, compare}

\item{pairlookup}{square matrix with rownames in list1 and colnames in list2.}

\item{round}{single character name of round column (default "round")}

\item{player1}{single character name of player one column (default "player1")}

\item{player2}{single character name of player two column (default "player2")}

\item{result}{single character name of result column (default "result")}

\item{list1}{single character name of player one's list column (default "list1")}

\item{list2}{single character name of player two's list column (default "list2")}

\item{compare}{single character, name of column to compare}
}
\value{
single numeric optimized difference between scorefrac
and p-steph for a player, given a list pair lookup
}
\description{
Calculate expected performance of a matchup for a player, given a list matchup.
pairlookup contains gamma correction for game between player one and player two.
Positive values favour player one, while negative values favour player two.
